# Data description

This folder is expected to contain the real Western Anatolia hydrogeochemical datasets
used in the paper, as well as the synthetic training data generated by the RGC model.

## Files

- `training_dataset.csv`  
  Real training subset of Western Anatolia geothermal springs and wells.  
  Columns:
  - `pH`
  - `EC (microS/cm)`
  - `K (mg/l)`
  - `Na (mg/l)`
  - `Boron (mg/l)`
  - `SiO2 (mg/l)`
  - `Cl (mg/l)`
  - `Reservoir temperature (°C)`

- `testing_dataset.csv`  
  Real test subset of Western Anatolia sites, with the same schema as the training file.
  Used exclusively for evaluating model generalisation (no training or tuning).

- `synthetic_rgc_train_only.csv`  
  Synthetic hydrogeochemical dataset generated by
  `notebooks/01_RGC_synthetic_data_generation.ipynb`, using **only** the
  real training dataset as input.  
  It has the same columns as `training_dataset.csv` and is used for:
  - DNN pre-training (notebook 02),
  - NGBoost RGC-augmented training (notebook 03).

## Data availability

The real training and test datasets are not distributed with this repository.
Access to these files is subject to the data-sharing conditions described in the paper
and must be requested from the corresponding author.
